# LUMEN Implementation Code
Implementation Code for "Enhancing Ethereum's Security with LUMEN: a Novel Homomorphic Polynomial Commitment Scheme with Recursive Proof Composition Applied to Interactive Oracle Proofs for Transparent Succinnt Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge" by Yunjia Quan

LUMEN is a zero-knowledge system that generates transparent zkSNARKs for zk Rollups


## Content
This repository is organized in the following folders:
- **PCS Code**: implementation of the LUMEN polynomial commitment scheme
- **Transparent SNARKs**: PCS compiler used on our polynomial IOP protocol
- **benches**: testing of LUMEN
- **src**: main.cpp
- **target** generated by visual studioes
